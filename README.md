# game21
This Python program plays the game of 21 with the user. The game consists of rounds. In each round, the user is asked if they’d like to roll (2 sixsided die). 
If they agree, the user rolls the die and the computer rolls their die. Their rolls are added to their individual totals. The user’s total is displayed at the end of each round; the computer’s total is hidden.
